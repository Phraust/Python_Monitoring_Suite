# NOTES & USAGE #
#################

LaunchD requires .plist files to be made for any services you
want to run.  There are tons of online requrces that go into 
this with much greater detail.

I just wanted to run scripts on recurring intervals with my
default user, so the path for this .plist location would be:

~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.phraust.CheckBFG.plist

You'll need to add this to LaunchD:

launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.phraust.WriteStats.plist

Then you'll need to start it:

launchctl start com.phraust.WriteStats

If you messed up, then you'll need to stop it, unload it, then
load it and restart it again.

Please research a little bit into this before messing with LaunchD.
It's probably pretty easy to mess up your system this way.
